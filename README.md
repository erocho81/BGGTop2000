BGG Top 2000

I will be including sql queries and python data analysis for a BGG Top 2000 dataset from Kaggle.

The original database for the BGG is much larger (more than 200k probably), but many of them have not enough ratings, plays etc, so the info could not be as accurate as it usually is with the top ones.

BGG stands for boardgamegeek which is the boardgame wikipedia:

Some information related to columns:
- weight: this is the difficulty of the game. It goes from 1 (very light) to 5 (very hard).
- rank: rank of the game depending on its rating.
- avg_rating: user rating for the game.
- min_time/max_time: duration of each play for the game.
- total_play: total user plays for a game.
- num_own: total number of users that have included the game in their collection as "own".
- num_wish: total number of users that have included the game in their collection as "wish".
